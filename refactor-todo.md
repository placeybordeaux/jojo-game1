# Jojo Game Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring roadmap to improve the codebase architecture and make feature development easier. The game currently has a legacy monolithic structure (`game.js`) alongside a new modular architecture (`src/`). 

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Strengths
- ‚úÖ Modular foundation with proper separation (`src/core/`, `src/systems/`, `src/config/`)
- ‚úÖ Event-driven architecture with EventBus
- ‚úÖ Component system foundation in GameObject
- ‚úÖ Configuration-driven design started
- ‚úÖ Asset management system

### Pain Points
- ‚ùå Split codebase (legacy + modular) creates confusion
- ‚ùå Game logic scattered across scenes and objects
- ‚ùå No centralized state management
- ‚ùå Scene transitions are basic
- ‚ùå Hard to add new features consistently

## Refactoring Priorities

### Priority 1: Complete Modular Migration üî•
**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**
**Impact: Critical**

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Extract Girl character from `game.js` to `src/objects/Girl.js`
- [ ] Extract Chickens from `game.js` to `src/objects/Chicken.js`
- [ ] Extract Items (Apple, Cookie, Orange) to `src/objects/Items.js`
- [ ] Extract OrangeTree to `src/objects/OrangeTree.js`
- [ ] Extract ChickenCoop to `src/objects/ChickenCoop.js`
- [ ] Convert indoor scene to `src/scenes/IndoorScene.js`
- [ ] Convert outdoor scene to `src/scenes/OutdoorScene.js`
- [ ] Convert kitchen scene to `src/scenes/KitchenScene.js`
- [ ] Convert bathroom scene to `src/scenes/BathroomScene.js`
- [ ] Test feature parity between old and new systems
- [ ] Remove legacy `game.js` file
- [ ] Update `index.html` to use modular version only

#### Success Criteria:
- All game features work in modular architecture
- No code duplication between systems
- Clear object responsibilities and boundaries

### Priority 2: Entity-Component-System (ECS) Architecture üöÄ
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**
**Impact: High**

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `src/components/MovementComponent.js`
- [ ] Create `src/components/InteractionComponent.js` 
- [ ] Create `src/components/RenderComponent.js`
- [ ] Create `src/components/CollisionComponent.js`
- [ ] Create `src/components/InventoryComponent.js`
- [ ] Refactor Girl to use components instead of inheritance
- [ ] Refactor Chickens to use MovementComponent
- [ ] Create ComponentManager for efficient component queries
- [ ] Add component-based animation system
- [ ] Document component patterns and examples

#### Benefits:
- Reusable behaviors across different objects
- Easy feature composition without complex inheritance
- Performance optimizations through component batching
- Easier testing of individual systems

### Priority 3: State Management System üìä
**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**
**Impact: Medium-High**

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `src/systems/StateManager.js`
- [ ] Define global game state schema
- [ ] Implement observable state with EventBus integration
- [ ] Add game progression tracking (achievements, unlocks)
- [ ] Create save/load system
- [ ] Add state debugging tools
- [ ] Migrate scattered state to centralized system
- [ ] Add state persistence across sessions

#### State Categories:
- **Player State**: position, inventory, hygiene, friendships
- **World State**: scene progress, object interactions, unlocked areas
- **Game State**: time, achievements, settings, flags
- **Session State**: current scene, temporary data

### Priority 4: Enhanced Scene System üé¨
**Timeline: 1 week**
**Impact: Medium**

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `src/systems/SceneTransitionManager.js`
- [ ] Add transition animations (fade, slide, etc.)
- [ ] Implement scene data persistence
- [ ] Add cutscene support
- [ ] Create scene preloading system
- [ ] Add scene-specific asset management
- [ ] Implement scene stacking (modals, overlays)
- [ ] Add transition sound effects

#### Features:
- Smooth animated transitions
- Data passing between scenes
- Scene history navigation
- Cutscene sequences
- Modal dialogs and overlays

### Priority 5: Configuration-Driven Features ‚öôÔ∏è
**Timeline: 1 week**
**Impact: Medium**

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Expand `gameConfig.js` with feature flags
- [ ] Add runtime configuration changes
- [ ] Create debug configuration panel
- [ ] Add A/B testing framework
- [ ] Make game mechanics configurable
- [ ] Add difficulty settings
- [ ] Create mod/extension system foundation
- [ ] Add configuration validation

#### Configuration Categories:
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable experimental features
- **Game Balance**: Speeds, timers, counts, difficulty
- **Debug Settings**: Logging, performance monitoring
- **Accessibility**: Text size, color schemes, input options

## Quick Wins (1-2 days each)

### Week 1 Quick Wins:
- [ ] Extract Girl object to modular system
- [ ] Convert indoor scene to new Scene class
- [ ] Add basic MovementComponent
- [ ] Create simple StateManager foundation

### Week 2 Quick Wins:
- [ ] Extract remaining game objects
- [ ] Add scene transition animations
- [ ] Implement component-based rendering
- [ ] Add configuration hot-reloading

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Focus on Priority 1 - complete the modular migration without breaking existing functionality.

### Phase 2: Architecture (Weeks 3-5)
Implement ECS system and state management. This will enable rapid feature development.

### Phase 3: Polish (Weeks 6-7)
Enhanced scene system and configuration management for production readiness.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- Component system functionality
- State management operations
- Scene transitions
- Configuration validation

### Integration Tests:
- Full game loop functionality
- Cross-scene data persistence
- Asset loading and management
- Event system reliability

### Performance Tests:
- Component system overhead
- Memory usage optimization
- Rendering performance
- Asset loading times

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality:
- Reduced code duplication (< 5%)
- Improved test coverage (> 80%)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent coding patterns

### Developer Experience:
- New feature implementation time reduced by 50%
- Bug fix time reduced by 40%
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Better debugging tools and visibility

### Maintainability:
- Modular, testable components
- Clear documentation and examples
- Configuration-driven behavior
- Easy feature toggling

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Performance Degradation**: Profile before/after refactoring
- **Feature Regression**: Comprehensive testing suite
- **Complexity Increase**: Clear documentation and examples

### Timeline Risks:
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined priorities
- **Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- **Resource Constraints**: Focus on quick wins first

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve Plan**: Stakeholder sign-off on priorities and timeline
2. **Setup Development Environment**: Testing, linting, build processes
3. **Create Feature Branches**: One branch per major refactoring task
4. **Begin Priority 1**: Start with Girl object extraction
5. **Regular Check-ins**: Weekly progress reviews and plan adjustments
